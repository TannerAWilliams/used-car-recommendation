'''
The Quality Index Rating (QIR)

Offers an overall score based on the frequency of power-train issues,
the mileage distribution of when those issues take place,
and the car age at the time of trade-in.

You can think of it as a weighted average where we look at a number of factors for a given car model,
and then get a single value indicating itâ€™s overall long-term reliability.
